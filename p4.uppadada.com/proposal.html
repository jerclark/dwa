						<h2>Abstract</h2>
					<i>Big Meals, No Whammies</i> is a web application that will help people plan meals and shopping lists for themselves or their families. This application is inspired by my family's recent usage of the meal plans and shopping lists available from <a href="http://www.100daysofrealfood.com">100daysofrealfood.com</a>.
						
					</div>
					
					<div class="content_box">
						<h2>Usage Overview</h2>
						Using <i>Big Meals, No Whammies</i> is relatively straigtforward. The basic flow is:
						<ul>
							<li>Create an account or Login to begin</li>
							<li>Add recipes (with instructions and ingredient lists) to your Recipe Bank</li>
							<li>Use the "Meal-o-Matic" to generate a "Big Board" of meals. The application will generate a meal plan, suggesting a breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner option for every day of the date range of the meal plan</li>
							<li>Adjust your meal plan by rearranging the suggested options, or by using alternatives from your recipe bank</li>
							<li>Use the auto generated "shopping list" to buy the necessary goods for the weeks meals</li>					
						</ul>

					<h2>Other Inspiration/Examples</h2>
					As stated earlier, I've decided to do this based on my family's recent foray into meal planning. There are MANY meal planners out there, some of them are pay services and others are free. I'm not sure I will put any of them out of business with my efforts, but I do think it's a good way to apply technology to something I'm interested in, go through the rubrick of P4, and try to get creative an differentiate a little bit.<br>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.100daysofrealfood.com">100daysofrealfood.com</a> - This is a blog site in which the blogger posts recipes and other food tips, all around the home-baked concept of "real" (i.e. non-processed) food. She shares meal plans and shopping lists, and I have found them useful. But they are static PDFs - it was my desire to make them more dynamic that lead me to want to make this project.
						<li><a href="http://www.foodonthetable.com/">Food on the table</a> - This is a pay site. Looks pretty nice, and appears to have integration with grocery stores and specials. It costs money, so I didn't pay to sign up.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.ziplist.com/recipes/meal_planner">Ziplist.com</a> - This is a free site, and it's pretty comprehensive in terms of sharing recipes, integration with stores/specials and generation of shopping lists. It also integrates with different calendar technologies, which is pretty cool. I'm not crazy about the planning UI.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/eatingwell_menu_planner">EatingWell.com Menu Planner</a> - This is also a free site - its more focused on calories count/weight management, as the first question you're asked is about BMI. It's obviously an add-on to a magazine with other motivations, but I do like the planning UI a little more than zip list:<br>
